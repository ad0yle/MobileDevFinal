	 Our Mission
	  </h1>
	  <p>
	  To culminate our learnings of mobile application development here at IU, this project will serve as a benchmark for future projects that will exemplify our improved technical skills surrounding mobile architecture and design concepts.

		<h2>
	  How We Serve You
		</h2>
		<p>
		The purpose of this project is to create a mobile web application that has both exceptional design and development focus. Our goal is to create a “Café Finder” which will allow users to enter their location and find the nearest shops to that specified location. This application will utilize a mobile application design to allow for seamless navigation between pages at any screen resolution for a better user experience. To achieve this goal, we will utilize our teachings involving application program interfaces (APIs) and mobile architecture that we’ve learned through our coursework to showcase our knowledge as it pertains to mobile development.
